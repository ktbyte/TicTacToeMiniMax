This Java library provides the interfaces and classes to represent a board/move in a tic-tac-toe game. The TicTacToeMiniMax class provides a generalized recursive AI to find the best possible move. The algorithm used for search is exhaustive recursive descent through minimax, where we assume +1 is X and -1 is O.
